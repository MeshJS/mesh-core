# mesh-csl

It is a Typescript wrapper around [`sidan-csl-rs`](https://github.com/sidan-lab/sidan-csl-rs) to add user-friendliness and useful APIs for building Cardano off-chain transactions. The APIs in this package are mostly low-level, closely tied with `sidan-csl-rs`. This package also serves some new utils functions that are yet to be packaged into `@meshsdk/core`.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @meshsdk/core-csl
```
